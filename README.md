## Questions (Q):

#### 1. Which genres are the most common (number of movies made)?

This plot ranks genres by the sheer number of movies produced. It reveals where the film industry’s creative energy has historically been concentrated, and provides insight into audience demand, risk appetite, and content trends.

![Genres Count](plots/genres_count.png)

*Analysis:*  
Genres like Drama, Comedy, and Action dominate the landscape, suggesting these formats offer the broadest appeal or are considered safer commercial bets. The presence of niche genres reflects both experimentation and the pursuit of underserved audiences.

---

#### 2. Which genres have high avg. budget and revenue?

Here we compare genres by their average production budgets and revenue outcomes. This visualization helps identify genres that command the largest investments and yield the greatest financial returns, informing both strategic funding and marketing priorities.

![Genres Budget and Revenue](plots/genres_budget_revenue.png)

*Analysis:*  
Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi genres attract the highest budgets, often due to visual effects, stunts, or established franchises. These genres also return strong revenues, but profitability is not guaranteed—high costs can erode margins. Conversely, some mid-budget genres may achieve outsized returns relative to their risk.

---

#### 3. Which genres have highest avg. profit?

Profitability is the ultimate business metric. This plot compares the mean profit by genre (revenue minus budget), helping reveal which genres provide the best financial efficiency and risk-reward profile.

![Genres Profit](plots/genres_profit.png)

*Analysis:*  
Genres like Horror and Thriller often emerge as profit leaders—despite smaller budgets, they deliver high returns, driven by dedicated fanbases and efficient production models. Major blockbusters (Action, Adventure) can be lucrative but are exposed to higher risk if revenue targets are not met.

---

#### 4. Which genres have a high average popularity?

Popularity is a leading indicator of cultural resonance and long-tail value (e.g., streaming, merchandising). This plot highlights which genres most consistently generate buzz, measured by audience engagement and attention metrics.

![Genres Popularity](plots/genres_popularity.png)

*Analysis:*  
Genres such as Action, Animation, and Fantasy lead in average popularity, often due to their broad demographic appeal and franchise potential. Sustained popularity suggests strong merchandising and cross-platform opportunities.

---

## Research Hypothesis

#### 1. The best movies according to vote average return high profit and revenue.

Does critical acclaim reliably drive commercial performance? These visualizations test if top-rated movies by vote average also succeed financially.

![Vote Average vs Profit](plots/vote_average_vs_profit.png)
![Vote Average vs Revenue](plots/vote_average_vs_revenue.png)

*Analysis:*  
While higher-rated films often achieve solid profits and revenues, the data reveals a wide spread. Some critically acclaimed movies underperform at the box office, and vice versa, underscoring the importance of aligning creative ambition with audience expectations.

---

#### 2. The best movies according to popularity return high profit and revenue.

Here we evaluate whether popularity metrics (e.g., online engagement, social buzz) are better predictors of financial success than critical acclaim.

![Popularity vs Profit](plots/popularity_vs_profit.png)
![Popularity vs Revenue](plots/popularity_vs_revenue.png)

*Analysis:*  
Popularity is more strongly correlated with revenue and profit, suggesting that effective marketing and audience engagement strategies are as vital as film quality. Movies with pre-release buzz or viral appeal tend to outperform, regardless of their critical reception.

---

#### 3. Highly budgeted movies return high revenue and profit.

This section analyzes the relationship between production spending and financial outcomes, highlighting the opportunities and risks of big-budget filmmaking.

![Budget vs Revenue](plots/budget_vs_revenue.png)
![Budget vs Profit](plots/budget_vs_profit.png)

*Analysis:*  
A clear positive relationship exists between budget and revenue, but profit margins can be compressed by overspending. Some low- and mid-budget films achieve remarkable profitability, showing that disciplined resource allocation and creative execution can outpace brute-force spending.

---

#### 4. High-budget movies have a high popularity.

Does investment in production and marketing reliably buy audience attention? This plot explores the link between budget size and popularity.

![Budget vs Popularity](plots/budget_vs_popularity.png)

*Analysis:*  
Larger budgets typically generate more hype and engagement, but the effect is not absolute. Well-executed indie films occasionally break through, proving that originality and timing can rival high-budget marketing blitzes.

---

#### 5. Look at profit per genre per year

Tracking profit by genre and year uncovers industry trends and signals shifts in audience taste, allowing stakeholders to spot emerging opportunities or waning formats.

![Profit per Genre per Year](plots/profit_per_genre_per_year.png)

*Analysis:*  
Profitability trends fluctuate over time; for example, genres like Animation and Sci-Fi may rise during technology booms, while others contract. Businesses that monitor and respond to these shifts can better position their portfolios for future growth.
